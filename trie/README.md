# ðŸŒ³ Trie Data Structure Implementation

This project implements a **Trie** data structure in C++. It's designed to practice using **tries** for efficient information retrieval.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation

In this project, we will implement a Trie to store a list of words. The Trie will support insertion, search, and deletion operations. This data structure is particularly useful for autocomplete and spell-checking features.

## ðŸš€ Usage

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matth-L/data-struct-compendium.git
cd trie
```

To build and run the Trie implementation, use the following commands:

```bash
make
./test
```

To clean up the build files, use:

```bash
make clean
```

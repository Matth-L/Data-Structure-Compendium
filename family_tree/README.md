# 🌳 Family Tree Simulation 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

This project simulates a family tree, allowing us to practice concepts related to N-ary Trees and Linked Lists.

## 📋 Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Make
- CxxTest (for running tests)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **📂 Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Matth-L/data-struct-compendium.git
    ```

2. **🔧 Build and Run the Program:**

    ```bash
    cd family_tree
    make
    ./arbre
    ```

3. **🧪 Run Tests:**

    We've created tests to verify the tree implementation. To run the tests, use:

    ```bash
    make test_f
    ```

# ğŸ”— Doubly Linked List with Multithreading

This exercise involved setting up a **doubly linked list** that would be traversed by multiple threads.

## ğŸ”§ Implementation

In this project, we will implement a doubly linked list that supports insertion, search, and deletion operations. This data structure will be traversed by multiple threads to demonstrate concurrency management.

## ğŸš€ Usage

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matth-L/data-struct-compendium.git
cd distributed_list
```

To build and run the doubly linked list implementation, use the following commands:

```bash
make
./distributed_list
```

To clean up the build files, use:

```bash
make clean
```
